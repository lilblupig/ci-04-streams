# Streams Website

[View the live project here](https://lilblupig.github.io/streams/)

This is the orientation exercise for Git, GitHub and GitPod as provided by Code Institute.  It is designed to allow very new coders to work with GitPod, GitHub and Git for the first time.

## User Experience
---
### User Stories

1. **First time user**

   May be a visitor who knows the budding coder, a tutor, or a potential employer.
     * A person known to the coder will likely want to look at the work of their friend or relative.  They will likely click through each page quickly before leaving.
     * A tutor will likely be looking more at the design and production of the page, and may test the page on various mock viewports as well as ensuring no broken links etc.
     * A potential employer will likely examine this page briefly before moving onto more recent projects.

2. **Returning user**

   Regardless of user type, will likely be returning to look for any changes since last visit, or to see if errors or odd pieces of code/design are present at this early stage.

3. **Frequent user**
   It is unlikely that there will be any frequent users of this site due to the very basic purpose for its existence.

### Design

   * The page follows a basic contrast design of white and dark grey.  
   * These colours invert when highlighted by the user to provide feedback in relation to active components.
   * A basic attempt at regulating and centering the images in a grid has been made, however this does not react well to responsive design.

### Wireframes

   * We have not yet learned about wireframes, so there are none.

No testing undertaken at this time.

## Bugs
---
_Insert many cry laughing emoji here!!!_  
Probably many bugs I don't even know are a thing yet.  
Mostly though:
* Page unresponsive to any kind of resized viewport
* Centering horrid, and image constriction very basic, distorts page on resized
* No footer
* Images improperly linked as just for learning purposes

2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
3. Alternatively Click Here for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
4. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
5. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
6. The page will automatically refresh.
7. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.
